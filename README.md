Color-Find
==========

Play Color Find - a game you play with the world around you.

Color Find is a game where you must take a photo with a specified color in it. If the color is in the photo, the app will say Found and given you a new color to find. The game seems easy at first, but you can make it as hard, and as interesting as you want it to be. Try playing in unique areas, such a while driving (as a passenger), on a hike, in the mall, at school, etc.

Tips:

If the app says the specified color is not in the photo, and it is, try adjusting your camera settings, especially exposure, color balance, or any specialized modes. It is a good idea to play the game in good light or outdoors.
The app is designed for phone sized screens, but can be played on a tablet just fine, although there may be sizeable blank space. Device must have camera; works with all cameras, and uses the default camera application.

--------------

Known Bugs: When changing orientation in camera app, return to Color Find causes an error, requiring the user to skip color and go to the next. Does not crash.
